            Yesterday,<br>
            All those backups seemed a waste of pay.<br>
            Now my database has gone away.<br>
            Oh I believe in yesterday.

            Suddenly,<br>
            There's not half the files there used to be,<br>
            And there's a milestone hanging over me.<br>
            The system crashed so suddenly.<br>
            I pushed something wrong,<br>
            What it was I could not say.
        </div>

        <div class="verse orange">
            Now all my data's gone and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

        <div class="verse orange-red">
            Yesterday,<br>
            The need for back-ups seemed so far away.<br>
            I knew my data was all here to stay,<br>
            Now I believe in yesterday.
